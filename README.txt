This project is a collaborative writing website focused on fan-made short stories inspired by popular video games. The goal is to expand existing lore, allowing fans to read and contribute unique takes on familiar characters and worlds. Initially built as a traditional web platform, the site may later integrate decentralized technologies (dApp) for enhanced community ownership and collaboration.
